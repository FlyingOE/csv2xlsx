## CSV2XLSX

Finally: a simple, single file executable, no runtime libs command line tool to convert
a CSV file to XLSX. And you may even select line and column ranges. :-)

This programm has been created due to an internal requirement for a Bash shell script. After searching
the web I found out that even in 2017 there is no simple, binary executable that does not need any
runtime, virtual machine or whatever. All you need is a compiler for the Go programming language.
If you do not want to compile the source and you decide to trust me (no warranty whatsoever, see the
license below), you may download the binary.

Here are the SHA-256 checksums for the binaries:

Please see below for a list of command line options.

  -abortonerror
    	abort program on first invalid cell data type
  -autoformula

  -exceldateformat string
    	Excel format for date cells (default as in Excel)
  -filemask
        bulk mode, specify a file mask here (e.g. "/use/docs/datalib/2018*.csv")
        make sure to quote the filespec to prevent shell globbing
  -h	
  -help
    	display usage information
  -infile string
    	full pathname of input file (CSV file)
  -outfile string
    	full pathname of output file (.xlsx file)
  -outdir 
        path to a target directory for the xlsx files (must exist and be writable)      
  -rows string
    	list of line numbers to use (1,2,8 or 1,3-14,28)
  -sheet string
    	tab name of the Excel sheet (default "fromCSV")
  -silent
    	do not display progress messages
  -noheader
    	do not use the first line as header (default is Yes)

        Column ranges are a comma-separated list of numbers (e.g. 1,4,8,16), intervals (e.g. 0-4,18-32) or a combination.
        Each comma group can take a type specifiers for the column,
        one of "text", "number", "integer", "currency", date", "standard", "formula"
        separated from numbers with a colon (e.g. 0:text,3-16:number,17:date)

### Source

This tool fulfills a special requirement and I will extend its functionality, if need arises. As I found out there are lots 
of people looking for such a tool, I decided to make it publicly available. I am in the process of learning Go and therefore
I am sure there are much better, more Go-idiomatic ways to achieve this functionality. If you have feedback on how to improve
the code or want to contribute, please do not hesitate to do so. I'd really like to improve my GO skills and learn things.
As my spare time for coding is limited to some hours around midnight a week, so please have some patience with my answers.
I am still amazed what you can accomplish within less than 500 lines of code in terms of making my admin part of life easier. :-)
